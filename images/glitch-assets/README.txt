Art & Code from the Game Released into Public Domain
The collaborative, web-based, massively multiplayer game Glitch began its initial private testing in 2009, opened to the public in 2010, and was shut down in 2012. It was played by more than 150,000 people and was widely hailed for its original and highly creative visual style.

The entire library of art assets from the game, has been made freely available, dedicated to the public domain. Code from the game client is included to help developers work with the assets. All of it can be downloaded and used by anyone, for any purpose. (But: use it for good.)

Tiny Speck, Inc., the game's developer, has relinquished its ownership of copyright over these 10,000+ assets in the hopes that they help others in their creative endeavours and build on Glitch's legacy of simple fun, creativity and an appreciation for the preposterous. Go and make beautiful things.

About Glitch
Glitch was a labor of love, created by a passionate and diverse team filled with wonderful talents. It also had a fanatical community of players who created a world of their own inside the game.

Unfortunately, the game was not commercially viable. But all good things come to an end, etc. Shutting the game down was heartbreaking (see the closing announcement), but, by releasing the game's art to the public domain we hope Glitch will live on.
